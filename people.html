              <h5>SUBJECTS: WEB DESIGN, COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h5>
              <p>I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa.
                I am also interning for the Honolulu Fire Department as a programmer and a regular
                member of ACM@UHM and SWITCH-UHM, both of which are computer science related clubs.
                I have previously also tutored at Kaimuki High School AVID program in all high
                school subjects and served as peer advisor for the students. I love mentoring
                because it is a way to give back to my community and it also feels amazing to see
                the passion in my students as they learn and strive for more. <a
