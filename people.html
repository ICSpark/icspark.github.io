                <h5>SUBJECTS: WEB DESIGN, COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h5>
                <p>I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am also interning for the Honolulu Fire Department as a programmer and a regular member of ACM@UHM and SWITCH-UHM, both of which are computer science related clubs. I have previously also tutored at Kaimuki High School AVID program in all high school subjects and served as peer advisor for the students. I love mentoring because it is a way to give back to my community and it also feels amazing to see the passion in my students as they learn and strive for more. <a href="https://gumsanaung.github.io/">Website</a></p>

                <p>Aloha! My name is Boyang Zhang. I am studying physics at UH Manoa. I came to Hawaii from China in Fall 2016. I like the weather and beautiful views here and enjoy the multi-cultural environment very much. I like hiking, playing tennis, trying different restaurants and I want to visit other islands when I am free.
                  Currently, I am doing data analysis with python for a physics research project. Python is one of the most popular and easy-to-learn programming language. If you are interested in learning python, feel free to talk with me when I am around.</p>
