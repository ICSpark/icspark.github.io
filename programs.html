        <h2>PROGRAMS</h2>
        <p>All of our programs are <strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">free</strong> and geared towards 6th - 12th grade students and lead by undergraduate mentors.
        No prior coding knowledge is required. Parents and students will attend a mandatory orientation at the beginning of the program
        semester prior to the beginning of classes. Classes will be held at the computer labs in the Pacific Ocean Science and Technology (POST) building
        on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus. Upon registration, we will contact you by email with more details regarding the specific time and place.</p>

        <p><strong style="font-family:sans-serif;">Registration is open from December 11, 6:00 am - January 11 11:59 pm on a first sign-up, first served basis. </strong>If we receive a large volume of registrations that surpass our
          maximum student capacity (~50 students per semester in both the 3 month and open lab programs), we hope to provide this service every academic semester to offer all interested students the opportunity to participate in these programs.
          We encourage you to spread the word about these free programs to students you think may benefit. </p>

        <p>At this time, you will only be allowed to register for one, not both, programs. We encourage absolute beginner coders to start with the Intro to Web Development course, and others with more experience to try the open lab for more personalized and guided mentorship at any skill level.
        Both programs are geared towards motivated students who are open and willing to learn in a new environment with college peers. </p>
        <p>Parents and students who register after all spots have been filled may be considered for a spot in our next semester program, if sufficient interest is generated. </p>

              <p>This is a flexible, unstructured mentorship program where students with any coding background can seek 1-on-1 or small group
              mentorship with available undergraduate mentors. More information on which programming languages or subjects that our mentors can help
              with is on our <a href="people.html">PEOPLE</a> page. If a language is currently not offered, our mentors may be able to help you
              accomplish what you would like to do, just ask! </p>
              <p>During this time, students can work on personal coding projects and ask questions when needed. </p>
              <p>A maximum of 20 students per week can be accommodated. Students are not committed to attend every week, thus, after a student is registered, they can attend any Open Lab session.</p>
